This project is a part of my school assignment and also a showcase of my skills as a frontend developer. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive website that displays some of my previous works and achievements. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of the frontend concepts and technologies that I have learned in the course.
